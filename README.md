# Hurricane-Evac-Simulator

An assigmnet I made for an intro course on Artificial Intelligence. 
The program simulates agents(evac vehicles) working in a hurricane scenario,
and trying to evcuate to saftey as much people as possible.
The agents use several search algorithms: 
- Uniform-Cost Search (Dijkstra)
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search
- A simplified version of Real-Time A* search
