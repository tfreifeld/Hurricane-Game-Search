# Hurricane-Game-Search

An assigmnet I made for an intro course on Artificial Intelligence. 
The program simulates agents(evac vehicles) working in a hurricane scenario,
and trying to evcuate to saftey as much people as possible, in adversarial, semi-cooperative and cooperative game scenarios. 
The program implements the minimax algoirthm (in adversarial search) and use heuristic evaluation functions.
